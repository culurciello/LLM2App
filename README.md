Can we create an iOs App with LLMs and knowing limited coding tools? We want to enable anyone to be able to create and publish simple phone apps with limited coding knwoledge and using modern AI tools.



## Intro

We are testing:

- Gemini pro
- ChatGPT3.5
- Google AI Studio - freeform prompt


## tools

`github2llm.py` can take an entire repository (for example an iOs App) and convert it to a text prompt for LLMs.

`prompt.txt` a testing prompt to create an App

## Results

- Gemini pro: good results

- ChatGPT3.5: skips a lot of code details / leaves to implement yourself.

- Google AI Studio: giving most detailed results on code and structure so far.
